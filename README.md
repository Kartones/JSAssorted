Javascript Assorted code
========================

Miscellaneous Javascript code snippets and experiments.

* `\pubsub-modules` : Micro-framework built to prepare a small module-based architecture for Javascript, using pub-sub pattern. Includes two sample modules to test the FW capabilities. Just the very basic functionality, nothing advanced.
* `NoCSS.js` : Small snippet I built to clear pages from CSS styles, Javascript, Blogger iframes and similar stuff and focus on reading the content. Ready to use as a bookmarklet in Firefox/Chrome.
* `SNCleaner.js` : Code snippets to launch from Firebug or Google Chrome's Developer tools, that will clean all your wall posts from the social network Tuenti.
I made this script because the same that Twitter's API allows to clean your old tweets I wanted to clean my old wall posts. Privacy paranoia if you wish to call it that way.
