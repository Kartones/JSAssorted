Javascript Assorted code
========================

Miscellaneous Javascript code snippets and experiments.

* `\barcode-wars` : Barcode Wars is a tiny javascript game for Firefox or Chrome that allows to read a barcode and play a small turn-based battle with an enemy, both generated based on the barcode. More info can be found here: http://kartones.net/blogs/kartones/archive/2012/10/03/barcode-wars-small-javascript-game.aspx and you can play the game here: http://kartones.net/demos/017/
* `\pubsub-modules` : Micro-framework built to prepare a small module-based architecture for Javascript, using pub-sub pattern. Includes two sample modules to test the FW capabilities. Just the very basic functionality, nothing advanced.
* `\the-plague` : Small Javascript & HTML5 game in which you are a plague that has to infect all cells before dying. Play it here: http://kartones.net/demos/018/
* `circle_points.html` : Small sample to remember how to distribute points inside a circumference.
* `NoCSS.js` : Small snippet I built to clear pages from CSS styles, Javascript, Blogger iframes and similar stuff and focus on reading the content. Ready to use as a bookmarklet in Firefox/Chrome.
* `SNCleaner.js` : Code snippets to launch from Firebug or Google Chrome's Developer tools, that will clean all your wall posts from the social network Tuenti.
I made this script because the same that Twitter's API allows to clean your old tweets I wanted to clean my old wall posts. Privacy paranoia if you wish to call it that way.
