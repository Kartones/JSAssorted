### Games-related

* `\pac-man`:  A [Pac-Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man) clone, based on a tutorial but with a few graphics & AI improvements. Ghost AI is still dumb, but at least now they try to get out of the lair and don't enter back. Play it [here](https://kartones.net/demos/025/).

### Miscellaneous

* `\pubsub-modules` : Micro-framework built to prepare a small module-based architecture for Javascript, using pub-sub pattern. Includes two sample modules to test the FW capabilities. Just the very basic functionality, nothing advanced.
* `circle_points.html` : Small sample to remember how to distribute points inside a circumference.
* `NoCSS.js` : Small snippet I built to clear pages from CSS styles, Javascript, Blogger iframes and similar stuff and focus on reading the content. Ready to use as a bookmarklet in Firefox/Chrome.
* `madivachallenge.appspot.com.js` : Solution to first challenge of the Madiva challenge. If I have time I might do the rest.
