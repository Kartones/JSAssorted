Javascript Assorted code
========================

Miscellaneous Javascript code snippets and experiments.

* `NoCSS.js` : Small snippet I built to clear pages from CSS styles, Javascript, Blogger iframes and similar stuff and focus on reading the content. Ready to use as a 
bookmarklet in Firefox/Chrome.
* `SNCleaner.js` : Code snippets to launch from Firebug or Google Chrome's Developer tools, that will clean all your wall posts from the social network Tuenti.
I made this script because the same that Twitter's API allows to clean your old tweets I wanted to clean my old wall posts. Privacy paranoia if you wish to call it that way.
